# TNG Technology Consulting GmbH

[TNG](https://www.tngtech.com/) is a value-based consulting partnership focused on high-end information
technology. We provide know-how and support in three main areas: Software
Development, DevOps & Cloud and Artificial Intelligence. We are fully committed
to technical innovation and its implementation for our clients' needs.

At TNG we recognize the importance of Free Software. Many of our employees are
actively involved in open source projects on their techdays (the time that TNG
allows for further education). TNG also publishes and maintains [several open
source projects](https://github.com/TNG) which have either evolved from or were inspired by customer
projects and which give the employees the chance to get actively involved.

Examples for our projects are:

*  [ArchUnit](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit#readme): a framework that enables verification of application architecture
   using simple unit tests
*  [JGiven](https://github.com/TNG/JGiven#readme): a tool to write unit tests in a domain-specific language using
   techniques from behavior-driven development
